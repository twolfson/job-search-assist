# Job Search Assist (JSA)
Browser extension to avoid seeing the same job/company listing twice

## Problem Definition
> "Ugh, I refreshed the page and am seeing the same listings!" - Me

> "I just saw this company on another site!!" - Also me

In user story form: As a job searcher, I want to avoid reading the same job/company listing twice

## Solution
A browser extension which:
- Surfaces a "Hide Company" button on supported websites
- Hides job/company listing on click, on refresh, and across all websites

TODO: Demo video goes here

## Installation
We don't know how relatable this problem is to other people. As a result, the setup and update process is janky:

1. Install [Greasemonkey][]
    - If you are not using [Firefox][], let me know and I can add support for [Violentmonkey][]
2.

If we get enough adoption, then I can formalize this into a proper web extension (just has more upfront development effort).
