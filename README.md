# Job Search Assist
Browser extension to avoid seeing the same job/company listing twice

## Problem Definition
> "Ugh, I refreshed the page and am seeing the same listings!" - Me
>
> "Grr, I just saw this company on another site!!" - Also me

In user story form: As a job searcher, I want to avoid reading the same job/company listing twice

## Solution
A browser extension which:
- Surfaces a "Hide Company" button on supported websites
- Hides job/company listing on click, on refresh, and across all websites

## Installation
1. Install [Violentmonkey][]
2. Open <https://github.com/twolfson/job-search-assist/raw/main/src/index.user.js>
3. Click "Confirm Installation" then "Close"
4. Navigate to <https://www.techjobsforgood.com/> and verify the new "Hide Company" button appears

For easier upfront development, we built this on top of [Violentmonkey][]. If we get enough adoption, then we can formalize this into a proper [browser extension][].

## Commands
In addition to hiding companies, we also provide commands under "Violentmonkey icon -> Job Search Assist"

These will only appear when on a supported site

The commands are:

- Dump Hidden Companies (outputs to console)
- Clear Hidden Company List

It's very easy to add support for "Undo Changes in Last 5 Minutes", "Unhide Company", or something along those lines. If you'd like support for that, please [Open an issue][] or [send me an email at todd@twolfson.com](mailto:todd@twolfson.com)

## Updates
To update to the latest version:

1. Open <https://github.com/twolfson/job-search-assist/raw/main/src/index.user.js>
2. Click on "Confirm re-installation" the "Close"

## Development
Development was somewhat janky as well due to using [Greasmonkey][], but faster than iterating with build steps and pressing a "Reload" button

- Edit either (locally + copy content to Violentmonkey) OR edit directly inside of Violentmonkey
- When ready to commit, copy content to local editor and commit changes

- Alternatively, Violentmonkey does seem to [support local editor without copy/pasting][vm-editing] but we have yet to try it
