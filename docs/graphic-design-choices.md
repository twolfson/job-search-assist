# Graphic Design Choices
We haven't made many graphic design choices yet, but we do have a design concept (what we want to communicate) backing them.

## Concept
The concept is far from locked in, but some rough wording that comes to mind:

- "job search tools"
- "job search magic"

There's many more possible angles which might change things (e.g. assistance, superpower, empowerment, etc)

## Realized Choices
The only choice we've made so far I believe is purple. And purple is coming from the "job search magic" idea

It's mysterious and reminiscent of a [magic hat][], a [magic 8 ball][], or other items in this vein
